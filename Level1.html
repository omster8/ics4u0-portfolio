	The main plot of the story: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		There is a village called Vaughan. Vaughan has 20 pigs, 40 wolves, and 32 houses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		There is a male pig named Julien. Julien has a gold-rimmed monocle and a black top hat. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Mort is a wolf that lives in house number 12. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		In our story Julien starts by eating food and telling everyone how hungry he is, then he goes to blow down Mort’s house.<br><br>
	
	Every village has a key ingredients: houses, pigs, wolves, and restaurants. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		A standard town has 30 houses and 2 restaurants.<br><br>

	The general idea of the story: The pig gets his revenge on the wolves from “3 Little Pigs”.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This story takes place in a Village called Vaughan. Vaughan has a population of 20 pigs, 40 wolves and there are 32 houses.<br><br>

	All mammals have a certain number of legs, brains, eyes, a gender, and a house number. They also either have fur or not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		When asked, they respond with their name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		A standard mammal starts off with 4 legs, 1 brain, and 2 eyes.<br><br>
	
	Pigs are based on the idea of mammals. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		They are identical, except that they have some additional qualities, namely a level of agreeableness, a monocle, a hat, a number of wolf houses they’ve blown down, and a level of hunger.
		<br><br>
	Whenever the pig eats something, the level of hunger goes down by 20%.<br><br>

	If an animal asks the pig how hungry it is, it responds with its level of hunger.<br><br>

	If the pig is supposed to blow a house down, the specified house gets blown down, and add one to the number of houses he has blown down.
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Then print out “Oh my gosh! {the specified house owned by the specified wolf has been blown down}” <br><br>

	Pigs are based on mammals but with additional characteristics: a level of agreeableness, a monocle, a hat, a number of wolf houses they’ve blown down, and a level of hunger.
