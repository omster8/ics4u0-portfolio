	Welcome to my last Java tutorial! In this tutorial we'll be learning <b>polymorphism</b>, which is the last of the "Big 3" of OOP (I'm assuming
	you've already learned about encapsulation and inheritance in my OOP tutorial). I'll step-by-step go through the concept of polymorphism,
	why it's useful, and where you'd want to use it. I'll also talk about a few things to be careful of when using polymorphism.<br><br>

	In simplest terms, polymorphism is the idea of constructing a superclass object using a subclass constructor. To understand exactly what this means
	and what it entails, we need to first learn about <b>upcasting</b> and <b>downcasting</b>. Let's say that we have two classes - Animal and Cat,
	where the class Cat extends Animal. Java has a feature known as upcasting, which is when you create an object like this:<br><br>
	<b>Animal a = new Cat (...);</b><br><br>
	What Java does is that it automatically upcasts (similarly to how an int can be upcasted to a double) the object 'a' so that it is labelled
	as an object of the Animal class. This means that although the object is technically of type Cat, the compiler treats it as if it is of type
	Animal. In this case, the object 'a' can only call methods of the Animal class and overridden methods of the Cat class. This should pretty
	much be review from my OOP tutorial. <br><br>
	
	Now what if you wanted to call methods of the Cat class that are not overridden through 'a'? Well, we have to use downcasting. We have to explicitly
	cast the object 'a' to type Cat and only then can we access Cat class methods:<br><br>
	<b>((Cat) a).someCatClassMethod ();</b><br><br>
	If you do not explicitly downcast like this, Java will not find the given method in the Animal class, causing a compile error.<br><br>

	Now, this should make it clear what I meant before when defining polymorphism: you declare an object of the superclass but instantiate it as an object
	of a subclass. Polymorphism is when you have multiple subclasses that all have an overridden method shared with their superclass. When you 
	create an object of that superclass but instantiate it as one of the subclasses and then call the overridden method, Java will automatically decide
	which version of the overridden method to use. This is what makes polymorphism so powerful, it allows you to perform a slightly modified task automatically by calling only one method,
	depending on the type of object. Going back to the Animal class example, let's say that the class has a method called makeSound which outputs the sound
	that that animal makes. Let's also say that there are several subclasses of the Animal class, each with their own implementation of the makeSound method
	(overridden methods). Now this shows the power of polymorphism:<br><br>
	<b>Animal d = new Dog (...);<br>
	// the makeSound method exists in the Animal class and in all of its subclasses<br>
	d.makeSound (); // automatically calls the method inside the Dog class and outputs "bark"<br><br></b>
	One last note on polymorphism is that it allows us to defy a few rules pertaining to interfaces and abstract classes. If you read my OOP tutorial,
	you might recall that I said you cannot instantiate abstract classes and interfaces. Well, polymorphism allows you to do so (sort of). Basically,
	you can create an object of an abstract class or interface but instantiate it as a subclass. Going back to the Animal example, if we created the Animal
	class as an abstract class, we would still be able to use upcasting, downcasting, and polymorphism. In that particular case, it also makes sense
	to make Animal abstract so we would not have to implement the makeSound method inside Animal (there isn't really a generic sound for all animals,
	so we could declare this method as abstract).

	One last thing to be careful of when upcasting and downcasting is that you must remember never to cast between subclasses of the same superclass.
	For example, <br><br>
	<b>Cat c = new Dog (...);</b><br><br>
	is not allowed and causes a ClassCastException. In most cases, it makes sense (you can't have a Cat that is a Dog) but it is something to keep in
	mind when casting between classes. <br><br>

	Finally, here is an example of polymorphism in action. There is an class called Animal with a method called getBloodType() that returns the blood type
	of that animal (as a String). There are also two subclasses of Animal - Mammal and Reptile - that have overridden versions of this same method. Therefore,
	when you create an animal object but instantiate it as a Reptile or Mammal object, it calls the getBloodType() method inside the Reptile or Mammal
	class, respectively. Here is a Github repository containing the .java files for this example:
