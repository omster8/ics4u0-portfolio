	My name is Om Patel, and welcome to my portfolio!
	On this page, you will find plenty of information about my personality, various hobbies, interests, and more.<br><br>

	Probably the briefest and most accurate way to describe me is that I'm a hardworking person with a passion to work with others and learn
	new concepts. I'm also a really outgoing person who likes hanging out with friends, whether it's playing frisbee after school or getting donuts
	on Fridays. My personality is warm and approachable. If you need help, I will try my best to help you. Finally, I'm a really curious person as I
	like asking lots of questions on new concepts.<br><br>

	According to personality test results, I am a very intuitive person who is proficient at understanding emotions. I'm also good at using my
	judgement to make decisions that I stick to, instead of changing my mind often. Here are a few of my results from various personality tests:

	Outside of school, I have a wide range of hobbies and activities that I enjoy. I like to read just about everything ranging from classic novels
	to science and technology magazines. I also enjoy watching educational videos such as Kurzgesagt. In my free time, I like working on small electronic
	projects, such as mini bladeless fans and motor-powered cars. After a long day at school I like to relax by listening to music or solving logic puzzles
	or sudoku. A few sports that I enjoy are ultimate frisbee, swimming, and cricket.<br><br>

	Finally, I also have a few strengths and weaknesses when it comes to school. Math is certainly my strongest subject in school but it's also a passion,
	whether it comes to math contests or just learning on my own. My strongest learning skills are probably initiative and teamwork. I'm always (usually)
	enthusiastic about learning a new thing, and I like to work in a team because I believe that more creative ideas are born when people brainstorm 
	as a team. On the other hand, public speaking is probably one of my weaknesses as I tend to get nervous and fidgety in front of large groups of people,
	and time management is not a strength either.<br><br>

	My goals in life are very simple: make businesses, solve problems that plague our daily lives, and become successful. I plan on becoming an entrepreneur
	in the future, while also pursuing further education in math and finance. But most importantly, I just want to live a happy life doing what I enjoy
	most.<br><br>

	I also plan to work on several programming related projects in the future. Over the summer, I want to learn about how to implement image-processing
	artifical intelligence in Java. I've already started learning about how AI works, such as gradient descent, and I hope to actually be able to
	implement the code soon.<br><br>
